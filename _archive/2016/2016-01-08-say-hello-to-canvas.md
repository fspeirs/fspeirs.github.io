I'm very pleased to announce the release of a new podcast on Relay FM.

Federico Viticci and I have been working on Canvas for a couple of months and we really think you're going to like it.

The TL;DR is that Canvas is a 30-40 minute show every two weeks dedicated to solving specific problems that arise when trying to do quote-unquote Real Work on iOS.

Each week, we will come to you with a discussion of a particular problem and solutions ranging from a turn-key app or technique that you can use to solve it to a Workflow or script that can do it.

As part of the show notes, we will also be sharing links to our actual Workflow, er, _workflows_ that we mention in the show itself.

Federico and I hope that Canvas will help more people to realise the benefits of doing more - or, indeed, everything - on iOS. We are walking the walk too: the show itself is edited and published entirely on iOS, using [Ferrite Recording Studio](https://appsto.re/gb/zOvU8.i).

Finally, although we are not offering open-ended personal tech support for any iOS problem in the world via Twitter, you can get in touch with us at [@\_CanvasFM](https://twitter.com/_canvasfm) on Twitter to suggest topics or tricky areas of iOS that you would like us to address on the show.
