Following up on [The Apple Soft Porn Store](/blog/2010/1/20/the-apple-soft-porn-store.html), Krapps [is reporting](http://KRAPPS.com/2010/01/30/apple-begins-removing-iphone-smut/) (NSFW) that Apple has started removing and rejecting apps that exist to show pictures of ladies in various states of undress.

I have no information to prove or disprove that my bug reports, articles and the subsequent [coverage on Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/01/parental-controls-glitch-gives-kids-access-to-app-store-porn.ars?comments=1) has anything to do with this policy change. There will, I understand, be an article in the Sunday Times this weekend on the issue (I was photographed for the piece on Friday).

My bug reports didn't request an App Store policy change, as much as a slightly tighter enforcement of the parental controls that already exist. Still, it's good to see Apple living up to their original intent for the App Store.

\[**Update**\] It strikes me that, although this wasn't what I asked for, it's probably less effort for Apple than trying to clarify the conflation of "contains smut" and "loads web pages" that the current ratings policy requires.
