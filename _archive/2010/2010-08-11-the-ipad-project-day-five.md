Due to various errands that had to be run today, I got very little iPad work done.

Really, the only meaningful progress was to verify and file a report against the iPhone Configuration Utility bug that I mentioned yesterday. For any Apple people in the audience, it's rdar://problem/8296089.

iOS 3.2.2 came out for iPads today, so I'm going to have to work out a plan for updating these iPads sooner rather than later. There's no way the delivered machines will be running 3.2.2 and there's no way I'm handing out 3.2.1 devices with a single-click jailbreak out in the wild.

We're close on this one. I can feel it.
